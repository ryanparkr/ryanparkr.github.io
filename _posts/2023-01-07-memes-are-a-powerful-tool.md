categories: [Crypto,Memecoins]
excerpt: It was Elon Musk who once said “Who controls the memes, controls the universe”. In crypto it's “Who controls the memes, controls the memecoin price”. Memes are a powerful tool for those who understand that & know how to use them.

"Meme” was first coined by Biologist Richard Dawkins in his 1976 book ‘The Selfish Gene’. Meant to be analogous to a human “gene” that is replicated and passed on, the “meme” was conceived as a “unit of culture” (an idea, belief, pattern of behavior, etc.) which is “hosted” in the minds of one or more individuals, and can replicate itself in the sense of jumping from the mind of one person to the mind of another.

Just as it is for a human gene, success for a meme is based on it’s contribution to the effectiveness of its host. A weak meme will die out quickly, while a strong meme will replicate and continue to be passed on and survive. Basically it all comes back to human beings want to copy, replicate and mimic other human beings, because that’s human nature, so strong memes continue to survive.

Now take the same concept with memes(memetics), add a coin/token/“unit of account”(crypto) that can be actively traded and a global, instant communication platform(X/Twitter) and things get pretty interesting when these things come together, that is basically the ingredients of what makes a “memecoin”.

If a “memes” power comes from the ability to be able quickly replicate information, ideas or beliefs across humans beings, then the “memecoins” power comes from the ability to literally “meme” itself into a coin/token with value by using X to replicate and quickly form consensus among groups of people that the coin/token does have a value.

If that small group knows how to use memes and fomo(fear of missing out) to it’s advantage on X, it can rapidly grow into an ever larger group, with the memecoin also rapidly going up in price. It is actually pretty fun and you can almost feel when everything begins to sync. The group begins to grow, the coin price is quickly rising and the group starts using memes as a way to try to grab attention on X.

Anyone who chooses to buy memecoins is aware that it’s a memecoin, so people *shouldn't* have any expectation for it to reach a certain price. The most likely scenario is you buy it, the hype will die down, the coin price will tank and you will lose money.

Memecoins are still a pretty new concept but watching people take culture(meme), value(coin) and communications(X/social media) and merge it into something totally is fascinating.
