Welcome to America, our taxes are high, the food is poison and our presidential candidates are one step away from being in a retirement home. Seriously, no one should be OK with trotting two 80+ year old boomers out on stage to insult each other. 

It wasn't a "Presidential debate" it was actually the final act of the Boomer generation who has held on to *everything* in this Country for far too long. Just like Real Estate, the Boomers held on to political power until the bitter, shameful end. 

**Disclaimer** - I'm fully behind Donald Trump. I want him back in the Whitehouse, mainly because he's embraced the crypto industry & it is important that the *American* crypto industry remains alive & well. 

With that said, honestly the entire thing was an embarrasment of how far our country has fallen. Trump definitely won, mostly because Biden couldn't put an actual coherent sentence together. 

Trump then proceeded to shoot off a bunch of false claims throughout the debate, which have now been [fact-checked](https://www.factcheck.org/2024/06/factchecking-the-biden-trump-debate/). Biden continued rambling incoherently then they argued about.......[Golf](https://www.youtube.com/embed/g9rfTP5XTUw?si=HawjwmnrhmyLmqJk). 

In all seriousness, Biden should drop out in my opinion. It's a shame his family & political party have continued to trot him out in public even though it has been obvious for awhile his mental capacity was in decline. 

There is no way anyone can listen to him speak for more than a minute or two & not think he probably has dementia. For the people who think Trump being back in the Whitehouse is scary, imagine how vulnerable we now seem to our adversaries like Russia & China.
