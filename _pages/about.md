My name is Ryan Parker. This is my personal blog where I publish long form thoughts on a lot of things(Life, Crypto, Politics etc...)
This blog is mostly for me to look back on and laugh at it. Also, for the slight chance that I post something on here that may be useful to someone else.

If you *somehow* find yourself on this page *someday* and you're feeling down, overlooked, underappreciated, lonely, unloved or just lost

**I want you to know:** 

*   YOU are loved

*   YOU matter

*   YOU are here for a reason

*   YOU are alive

*   YOU can think

*   YOU can change things

*   YOU can experience

*   YOU can **LOVE** other living things

*   **LOVE** is the answer
