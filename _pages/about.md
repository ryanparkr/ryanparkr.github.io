My name is Ryan Parker. This is my personal blog where I publish long form thoughts on a lot of things(Life, Crypto, Politics etc...)

This blog is mostly for me to look back on and laugh at it. Also, for the slight chance that I post something on here that may be useful to someone else.

If you want to contact me, check out the links at the bottom of the page. ðŸ‘‡
